with such tools. Learn there different impaces personally as well as the fields that use them. Apart from that, I enjoy
hiking long distances.

in Data Science/Engineering for focus in Big Data Complexity. As such, I will be starting University of Calfornia's San Diego
in Mathmatics-Computer Science which focuses on Algorithm Design & Computational Complexcities. Hope build more of this in
the field of Cryptography.
